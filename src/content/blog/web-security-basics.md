# Web Security Basics: A Beginner's Guide

Web security is a critical aspect of modern software development. In this post, we'll explore some fundamental concepts and common vulnerabilities that every developer should be aware of.

## Common Web Vulnerabilities

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Data theft
- Malware distribution

### 2. SQL Injection
SQL injection happens when attackers manipulate database queries through user input. This can result in:
- Unauthorized data access
- Data manipulation
- Database structure exposure

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CSRF attacks trick users into performing unwanted actions on a site they're authenticated to. Prevention includes:
- Using CSRF tokens
- Implementing SameSite cookies
- Validating request origins

## Best Practices

1. Always validate and sanitize user input
2. Use parameterized queries for database operations
3. Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. Keep all software and dependencies updated
5. Use HTTPS for all communications

## Tools for Security Testing

- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP
- Nikto
- SQLMap

Remember: Security is not a one-time implementation but a continuous process of monitoring and improvement.
